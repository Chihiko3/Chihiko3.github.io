            <h1>I. BASIC CONCEPTS</h1>
            <p></p>
            <h2 data-heading="BUILDING THE COGNITIVE MAP">BUILDING THE COGNITIVE MAP</h2>
            <p>To build a cognitive map, the observer should play an active role in perceiving the world and have a creative part in <strong>developing his image</strong> of the city. Cognitive images are the result of a two-way process between the observer and the environment. Thus, the image of a given reality may vary significantly among observers. </p>
            <p>The coherence of the image may arise in several ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>long familiarity of the object</li>
                <li>similarity of the stereotype already constructed in mind</li>
                <li>strong structure or identity due to striking physical features which suggest their own pattern</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 data-heading="LEGIBILITY">LEGIBILITY</h2>
            <p><strong>Legibility</strong> means the ease for people to recognized the city's parts and organized them into a cognitive map or image. Whenever people in the process of way-finding, they follow the cognitive map of the physical world, which was produced by immediate sensation and the memory of the past experience.</p>
            <p>It is true that there is some positive value in illegibility like labyrinth or surprise, but this kind of positive value only works under two conditions (complete chaos is never pleasurable):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>no danger of losing basic orientation or never coming out. The surprise must occur in an over-all framework and the confusions must be small regions in a visible whole</li>
                <li>the labyrinth or mystery must in itself have some form that can be <strong>explored</strong> and in time be apprehended</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 data-heading="COGNITIVE MAP ANALYSIS">COGNITIVE MAP ANALYSIS</h2>
            <p>A workable cognitive map can be analyzed into three components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>identity
                    <ul>
                        <li>the object's distinction from other object and its recognition as a separable entity</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>structure
                    <ul>
                        <li>the object's spatial or pattern relation to the observer and to other objects</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>meaning
                    <ul>
                        <li>the object's meaning for the observer, practical or emotional</li>
                        <li>meaning is also a relation but quite different from spatial or pattern relation</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since the "meaning" is less consistent and not influenced by physical manipulation like the other two components, it is difficult to conduct quantitative studies about it. Thus, we only concentrates on the "identity" and "structure" of cognitive maps.</p>
            <h2 data-heading="IMAGEABILITY (= APPARENT)">IMAGEABILITY (= APPARENT)</h2>
            <p>As discussed above, we focus on "identity" and "structure", which leads to the concept called imageability or apparent.</p>
            <p><strong>Imageability</strong> is the physical quality in a object which gives it a high probability of evoking a strong image in any given observer, and it is often related about SHAPE, COLOR, or ARRANGEMENT which facilitates the making of vivid <strong>identity</strong> and powerful <strong>structure</strong>.</p>
            <p>Legibility concludes imageability since the former contains three components (identity, structure, meaning) and the latter two (identity, structure). Moreover, we do not deny the importance of meaning. Our purpose is simply to consider the need of achieving "identity" and "structure" in our perceptual world.</p>
            <p>Like legibility, imageability is a two-way process between observer and observed. Therefore, we may <strong>strengthen the image on both sides</strong>: we are able to develop image of the environment by operation on the external physical shape as well as by an internal learning process.</p>
            <h1>II. ELEMENTS OF THE IMAGE</h1>
            <p>Notice again: this analysis limits itself to the effects of physical, perceptible objects and the meaning or something like it (social meaning, necessary function, history) was not included.</p>
            <p>Contents of the city images can be classified into five types of elements:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>paths
                    <ul>
                        <li>channels along which the observer customarily, occasionally, or potentially moves</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>edges
                    <ul>
                        <li>linear elements not used or considered as paths by observer. They are the boundaries between two phases, linear breaks in continuity: shores, railroad cuts, edges of development, walls. They are lateral references rather than coordinate axes</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>districts
                    <ul>
                        <li>can be recognized internally and externally</li>
                        <li>can be introvert with little reference to the city outside them and can be extrovert with connetion to surrounding elements</li>
                        <li>have various kinds of boundaries, some are hard, definite, precise and some are soft or uncertain. Moreover, some have no boundaries at all</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>nodes
                    <ul>
                        <li>the strategic foci into which the observer can enter, typically either junctions of paths, or concentrations of some characteristic</li>
                        <li>can be introvert or extrovert. Introverted nodes give little direction sense when one is in it and extroverted nodes explain general directions and connections to other places</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>landmarks
                    <ul>
                        <li>another type of point-reference but the observer does <strong>not enter</strong> within them, they are external. They are usually a rather simply defined physical object: building, sign, store, or mountain. Their use involves the singling out of one element from a host of possibilities
                            <ul>
                                <li>Some landmarks are distant ones, typically seen from many angles and distances, over the tops of smaller elements, and used as radial references</li>
                                <li>Other landmarks are primarily local, being visible only in restricted localities and from certain approaches</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>a sequential series of landmarks, in which one detail calls up anticipation of the next, can lead observers to some specific ways</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <p>Moreover, rather than a single comprehensive image for the entire environment, there seemed to be sets of images, which more or less overlapped and interelated. They were often arranged in series of levels, roughly by the scale of area involved.</p>

                <li>some images were developed along and then outward from familiar lines of movement
                    <ul>
                        <li><img alt="Pasted image 20230311171444.png" src="TheImageOfTheCity_img/Pasted image 20230311171444.png" class="internal-embed"></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>some images were begun by the construction of an enclosing outline
                    <ul>
                        <li><img alt="Pasted image 20230311171451.png" src="TheImageOfTheCity_img/Pasted image 20230311171451.png" class="internal-embed"></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>some images began by laying down a basic repeating pattern (like path grid) and then adding detail
                    <ul>
                        <li><img alt="Pasted image 20230311171458.png" src="TheImageOfTheCity_img/Pasted image 20230311171458.png" class="internal-embed"></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>some fewer images started as a set of adjacent regions, which were then detailed as to connections and interiors
                    <ul>
                        <li><img alt="Pasted image 20230311171507.png" src="TheImageOfTheCity_img/Pasted image 20230311171507.png" class="internal-embed"></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>some images developed from a dense familiar element on which everything was ultimately hung
                    <ul>
                        <li><img alt="Pasted image 20230311171513.png" src="TheImageOfTheCity_img/Pasted image 20230311171513.png" class="internal-embed"></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 data-heading="IMAGE QUALITY">IMAGE QUALITY</h2>
            <p>Images could be distinguished according to their structural quality (there are other distinguishing ways, but I thought the structural one is the only systematic one that can be figured following some rules). There were four stages along a continuum of increasing structural percision:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the various elements were free; there was no structure or interrelation between parts
                    <ul>
                        <li><img alt="Pasted image 20230311175437.png" src="TheImageOfTheCity_img/Pasted image 20230311175437.png" class="internal-embed"></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>the structure became positional; the parts were roughly related in terms of their general direction and perhaps even relative distance from each other, while still remaining disconnected
                    <ul>
                        <li><img alt="Pasted image 20230311175446.png" src="TheImageOfTheCity_img/Pasted image 20230311175446.png" class="internal-embed"></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>most often the structure was flexible; parts were connected one to the other, but in a loose and flexible manner, as if by limp or elastic ties
                    <ul>
                        <li><img alt="Pasted image 20230311175454.png" src="TheImageOfTheCity_img/Pasted image 20230311175454.png" class="internal-embed"></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>as connections multiplied, the structure tended to become rigid; parts were firmly interconnected in all dimensions; and any distorrions became built in
                    <ul>
                        <li><img alt="Pasted image 20230311175501.png" src="TheImageOfTheCity_img/Pasted image 20230311175501.png" class="internal-embed"></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h1 data-heading="III. GENERAL QUALITIES">III. GENERAL QUALITIES</h1>
            <p>A well designed city MUST invite its viewers to explore the world. There are general qualities that a designer should check and may operate upon in the process of designing city elements, which enhance the imageability. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Singularity (figure-background clarity):
                    <ul>
                        <li><img alt="Pasted image 20230312211706.png" src="TheImageOfTheCity_img/Pasted image 20230312211706.png" class="internal-embed"></li>
                        <li>sharpness of boundry</li>
                        <li>closure</li>
                        <li>contrast of surface, form, intensity, conplexity, size, use , spatial location</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Form Simplicity:
                    <ul>
                        <li>clarity and simplicity of visible form in the geometrical sense</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Continuity
                    <ul>
                        <li>continuance of edge or path </li>
                        <li>nearness of parts</li>
                        <li>repetition of rhythmic interval</li>
                        <li>similarity, analogy, harmony of surface, form or use</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><img alt="Pasted image 20230312212129.png" src="TheImageOfTheCity_img/Pasted image 20230312212129.png" class="internal-embed"></li>
                        <li>dominance of one part over others by means of size, intensity, or interest, resulting in the reading of the whole as a principle feature with an associated cluster</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Clarity of Joint
                    <ul>
                        <li>joints are the trategic moments of structure and should be highly perceptible</li>
                        <li>high visibility of joints and seams</li>
                        <li>clear relation and interconnection</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Directional Differentiation
                    <ul>
                        <li>asymmetries, gradients and radial references which differentiate one end from another or one side from another or one compass direction from another </li>
                        <li>heavily used in structuring on the larger scale </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Visual Scope
                    <ul>
                        <li><img alt="Pasted image 20230312220105.png" src="TheImageOfTheCity_img/Pasted image 20230312220105.png" class="internal-embed"></li>
                        <li>increase the range and peneration of vision, either actually or symbolically</li>
                        <li>transparencies</li>
                        <li>overlaps</li>
                        <li>vistas and panoramas which increase the depth of vision</li>
                        <li>articulating elements</li>
                        <li>concavity that exposes farther objects to view</li>
                        <li>clues about an invisible thing</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Motion Awareness
                    <ul>
                        <li>make sensible to the observer, through both the visual and the kinesthetic senses, his own actual or potential motion</li>
                        <li>give the experience of motion parallax and perspective</li>
                        <li>maintain the consistency of direction or direction change</li>
                        <li>make visible the distance interval</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Time Series
                    <ul>
                        <li>series which are sensed over time, inclding both simple item-by-item linkages</li>
                        <li>what would be imaged would be the developing pattern of elements rather than elements themselves</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Names and Meanings
                    <ul>
                        <li>non-physical characteristics which may enhance the imageability of an element</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Thus, a region would be unforgettable which had a simple form, a continuity of building type and use, which was singular in the city, sharply bounded, clearly jointed to a neighboring region, and visually concave.</p>
            <h2 data-heading="THE SENSE OF THE WHOLE">THE SENSE OF THE WHOLE</h2>
            <p>Form should be manipulated so that there is a strand of continuity between the multiple images of a big city: day and night, winter and summer, near and far. Those elements, landmarks, nodes or paths should be recognizable under diverse condition. It is not to say that the image should be the same, but the image should have similarity, like the shape of Louisburg Square in the snow has a shape that matches Louisburg Square in midsummer.</p>
            <p>While taking care of continuity, the contrast and specialization of individual character is also important. With the increase of familiarity, observers's attention to detail and to uniqueness increases.</p>
            <p>The city is not built for one person but for great numbers of people, of widely varing backgrounds, temperaments, occupations and class. The designer should create a city which is as richly provided with paths, edges, landmarks, nodes and districts as possible.</p>
